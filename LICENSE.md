# Dual License

Commercial or open-source? Send me an [**email**](mailto:1809702+omen23@users.noreply.github.com) to get in contact to discuss the better options.
With a commercial license you will have no insight to the source code but support.
If you choose the "open source" license you have insight to the source code but you have to contribute.
